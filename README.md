Iâ€™m Nikita, a machine learning enthusiast and powerlifting athlete. Currently, Iâ€™m studying machine learning and focusing on improving my skills in deep learning and ML algorithms. I enjoy building projects from scratch and exploring new technologies. My goal is to apply machine learning to solve real-world problems and continue growing as a specialist. When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me at the gym or reading on various topics!
